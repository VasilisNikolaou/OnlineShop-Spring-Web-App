# OnlineShop-Spring-Web-App
Today's modern websites especially e-commerce ones uses CMS like WordPress but i tried to make one from scratch for educational purposes.
This project tries to simulate a real world e-commerce web application but of course it lacks some features like admin dashboard.
Yet still the main functionality is there that is selection, navigation and eventually ordering of products.
